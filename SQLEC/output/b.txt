-- For each product category,
-- list the total number of orders for this category.
-- Even when an order contains multiple products in the category or large quantities of products in this category, it should be counted only once towards the total for that category.
-- Show the category name and the number of orders, sorted by the latter in descending order. If no order has been placed for a category, the number should be shown as 0.
-- For example, here are some sample rows from the correct output:
--   categoryname  | numorders 
-- ----------------+-----------
--  Beverages      |        37
--  Produce        |        10
--  Eclectic       |         0
